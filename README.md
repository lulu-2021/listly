# Listly

There are lots of occasions in Rails apps where you need simple lists, such as a list of States in a Country etc.
Listly is for when you want to store data in hash format in external yml type files such as storing them in the
rails locales files that can be retrieved from I18n.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'listly'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install listly

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
